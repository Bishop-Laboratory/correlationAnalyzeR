Description: Correlation AnalyzeR is a powerful tool for understanding how genes
    relate to eachother based on the world's largest repository of standardized
    RNA-Seq data, ARCHS4 [https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/archs4/index.html]. In 
    'single-gene' mode, correlation data for genes of interest are used to
    return correlated pathways by GSEA.In 'Gene vs gene' mode, the differences 
    between two genes of interest are elucidated based on their 
    co-expression correlations. In 'Gene vs gene list' mode, a user can
    examine how a primary gene of interest correlates with a defined list of
    other genes. Finally, 'Topology' mode examines correlation data for a
    defined gene group to generate a robust gene-level topology.
