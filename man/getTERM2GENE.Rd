\title{Obtains TERM2GENE object for corGSEA}
\usage{
getTERM2GENE(
  GSEA_Type = c("simple"),
  Species = c("hsapiens", "mmusculus"),
  sampler = FALSE,
  listReturn = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{GSEA_Type}{Which pathway annotations should be considered? Options listed in
correlationAnalyzeR::pathwayCategories -- See details below for more info.}

\item{Species}{Species to obtain gene names for.
Either 'hsapiens' or 'mmusculus'}

\item{sampler}{If TRUE, will only return 100,000 random genesets from either
simple or complex TERM2GENEs. Useful for reducing GSEA computational burden.}

\item{listReturn}{If TRUE, will return annotations as a list object.}
}
\value{
A tbl object with columns "gs_name" and "gene_symbol"
}

GSEA_Type category names and their MSIGDB description:

\strong{Hallmark} (a.k.a "H" in MSIGDB): "Hallmark gene sets summarize and represent
specific well-defined biological states or processes and display coherent expression.
These gene sets were generated by a computational methodology based on identifying
overlaps between gene sets in other MSigDB collections and retaining genes that display
coordinate expression."

\strong{Cytogenic bands} (a.k.a "C1" in MSIGDB): "Gene sets corresponding to each human
chromosome and each cytogenetic band that has at least one gene."

\strong{Perturbations} (a.k.a. "C2:CGP" in MSIGDB): "Gene sets represent
expression signatures of genetic and chemical perturbations. A number of these gene
sets come in pairs: xxx_UP (and xxx_DN) gene set representing genes induced
(and repressed) by the perturbation."

\strong{Canonical pathways} (a.k.a. "C2:CP" in MSIGDB): "Gene sets from pathway databases.
Usually, these gene sets are canonical representations of a biological process
 compiled by domain experts."

\strong{BioCarta} (a.k.a. "C2:CP:BIOCARTA" in MSIGDB): "Gene sets derived from the
BioCarta pathway database."

\strong{KEGG} (a.k.a. "C2:CP:KEGG" in MSIGDB): "Gene sets derived from the
KEGG pathway database."

\strong{PID} (a.k.a. "C2:CP:PID" in MSIGDB): "Gene sets derived from the
PID pathway database."

\strong{Reactome} (a.k.a. "C2:CP:REACTOME" in MSIGDB): "Gene sets derived from the
Reactome pathway database."

\strong{miRNA targets} (a.k.a. "C3:MIR" in MSIGDB): "Gene sets that contain genes
sharing putative target sites (seed matches) of human mature miRNA in their 3'-UTRs."

\strong{TF targets} (a.k.a. "C3:TFT" in MSIGDB): "Gene sets that share upstream
 cis-regulatory motifs which can function as potential transcription factor
  binding sites. Based on work by Xie et al. 2005"

\strong{Cancer gene neighborhoods} (a.k.a. "C4:CGN" in MSIGDB): "Gene sets defined
 by expression neighborhoods centered on 380 cancer-associated genes. This collection
 is described in Subramanian, Tamayo et al. 2005"

\strong{Cancer modules} (a.k.a. "C4:CGN" in MSIGDB): "Gene sets defined by Segal
 et al. 2004. Briefly, the authors compiled gene sets ('modules') from a variety of
 resources such as KEGG, GO, and others. By mining a large compendium of cancer-related
  microarray data, they identified 456 such modules as significantly changed in a variety
   of cancer conditions."

\strong{GO:BP} (a.k.a. "C5:BP" in MSIGDB): "Gene sets derived from the GO Biological Process Ontology."

\strong{GO:CC} (a.k.a. "C5:CC" in MSIGDB): "Gene sets derived from the GO Cellular Component Ontology."

\strong{GO:MF} (a.k.a. "C5:MF" in MSIGDB): "Gene sets derived from the GO Molecular Function Ontology."

\strong{Oncogenic signatures} (a.k.a. "C6" in MSIGDB): "Gene sets that represent signatures of cellular
 pathways which are often dis-regulated in cancer. The majority of signatures were generated directly
 from microarray data from NCBI GEO or from internal unpublished profiling experiments involving perturbation
 of known cancer genes."

\strong{Immunological signatures} (a.k.a. "C7" in MSIGDB): "Gene sets that represent cell states and
perturbations within the immune system. The signatures were generated by manual curation of
published studies in human and mouse immunology."

\strong{Cell Type signatures} (a.k.a. "C8" in MSIGDB): "Gene sets that contain curated cluster
 markers for cell types identified in single-cell sequencing studies of human tissue."

\strong{simple}: This is the combination of "Hallmark", "Perturbations",
"BioCarta", "GO:BP", "GO:CC", "GO:MF", "KEGG", "Canonical pathways", "PID", and "Reactome"

\strong{complex}: This includes all possible gene sets.
